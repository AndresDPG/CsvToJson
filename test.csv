Previous reports have shown the effectiveness of BP in treating cancer diseases. However, BP has no targeting capacity towards specific cancer cells. To improve treatment efficiency and reduce the dose of BP used in cancer treatment, targeting-based approaches should be developed. In the present study, we used riboflavin-5′-phosphate (RFMP) immobilized iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4 MNPs) as carriers for BP to treat cancer cell lines derived from liver, prostate and breast. These model cancer cells overexpress riboflavin receptors on their cell membrane and are also sensitive to BP treatment. Thus, BP-binding free RFMP on MNPs can be used as probes to target these model cells, whereas BP can be readily released on target cancer cells. Cell viability was twofold lower by using Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs immobilized with BP than that achieved by using free-form BP at a similar amount. Moreover, BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs have no apparent harmful effects on non-target cells. In addition, we evaluated the level of cysteine-aspartic acid protease 3 (caspase 3) in the resultant cell lysate obtained after treatment by BP-Fe3O4@RFMP MNPs to demonstrate that apoptosis is mainly involved in the growth inhibition of target cells. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Biotin-PEG-PCL polymers have been used for targeted drug delivery to cancer, as well as to improve the pharmacokinetics of the drug and reduce its effects. In this study, biotin-conjugated copolymers were fabricated with polymerization of the ring opening method and the properties of copolymer and nanoparticles were investigated using various techniques. The toxicity of artemisinin and its nanoparticles have been investigated on MCF-7 and normal HFF2 cells. The results showed that the encapsulation efficacy of artemisinin in nanoparticles was 45.5 ± 0.41%. The release profile of the drug indicates that the release is slow and controlled and is approximately pH dependent. The results of artemisinin cell culture on human breast cancer cells showed that biotin-PEG-PCL nanoparticles had an inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells and had no toxic effects on HFF2 cells. Anticancer activity in vivo in the 4T1 breast cancer model showed that tumour volumes were decreased up 40 mm3 by ART-loaded micelles and 76 mm3 by free ART, compared to the control group (2150 mm). In vivo results showed that this formulation significantly increases the accumulation of substances in the tumours. Therefore, the molecular formulation of ART-based copolymers can be a desirable process for cancer treatment purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Romio, M., Morgese, G., Trachsel, L., Poly (2-oxazoline)-pterostilbene block-copolymer nanoparticles for dual-anticancer drug delivery (2017) Biomacromolecules, 19, pp. 103-111;
